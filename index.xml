I still watched every Nebraska game start to finish and various other top 25 programs but I never saw Oral Roberts or Loyola Chicago this year.
To supplement my lack of first hand experience with some of the field of 64 this year I made a model that predicted the outcome of each game with a win or loss prediction.</description>
