<p>In our bracket group I finished 8th and in the 79.6 percentile of all brackets. In our class that was almost squarely in the middle of the pack though I did finish one spot above “I Miss Teddy Allen”. Our brackets seemed to be closely correlated because at the start of the challenge we were only separated by one spot at the bottom of the class. Overall, I think my model did a fine job of picking brackets as evidenced by being almost in the 80th percentile. This bracket did better than my other bracket I did without machine learning but my non machine learning one did have some upsets going far that were successful like UCLA and USC while the machine learning bracket picked a lot of favorites.
I missed the 8-9 Missouri and Oklahoma game where my model had a 58% percent Mizzou win and they lost. I watched that game and Mizzouri played pretty poorly and some of their better players were not getting along with the coaching staff which led to some bad play. My model also had Virginia beating Ohio with 85% certainty. That looks bad but Virginia was dealing with some major injury issues so I can chalk that one up to things that the model could not account for necessarily. Those were the two missteps in the West regional.
In the East I had two misses as well. First, St. Bonaventure lost an 8-9 game with a 53% chance of winning so that is close to a coin flip. Second Texas lost to Abilene Christian though my model said Texas would win 68% of the time. I watched this game and Texas had every opportunity to win and it would be tough for the model to predict this game with the inputs it had going in.
In the South I had 3 missteps for the model. Pudue had 77% confidence in a win and lost as a 4 seed. My model thought very highly of the Big10 with my SOS metric so there was no way it could see this upset happening with that bias. My model also fell to the Colgate curse and picked them over Arkansas with a 52% chance of winning. That was not a very strong prediction and that was as far as I had Colgate going so the model does not get penalized as much for that though it hurt its chances in the long run because Arkansas went on a run. Lastly, it gave Ohio St an 80% chance of winning over Oral Roberts. That is not as high as I thought it would be but I doubt many models would be capable of picking that upset.
The Midwest was my worst bracket quad. My model picked another 8/9 game wrong with Georgia Tech 61% over Loyola Chicago. That pick hurt the bracket and my model may have to be tuned because it went ¼ in 8/9 games which is not good since those are usually toss ups. Next the model had Tenn over OSU with 53% confidence. That is close to a toss up and showed Tenn’s weakness as the much higher seed. San Diego St over Syracuse with 56% certainty was not great either as the ‘Cuse marched forward for multiple wins but Syracuse was a team with a weak resume so that pick was understandable. Finally, my model chose Rutgers as the Big10 team not to like and of course they beat Clemson. My model was 60% sure in that game but with Rutgers being smacked by Nebraska earlier who can really blame the model. That had to hurt Rutgers rating and standing a little bit.
I think my model did not take into account enough recency bias. I did not have the conference tournament games in my data. It matters how a team has been doing recently more than at the start of the season. I liked my stats of rolling mean assists, tournovers, and effective field goal percentage in addition to SOS. I might have included a pace metric to help stabilize my engineering formula. I think that component of the game was missing and could have been added.
I thought this was a really cool experience and was glad the class was around March Madness because it was a nice way to implement what was learned. My own bracket was worse overall but had some parts that performed better like some upsets I really liked that came true that the model did not. The model kept its score high by not losing its final 4 early while the one on my own did by really liking Illinois and Ohio State while the model did not. I think a combination would lead to the best results so I can take my knowledge, injuries and the model predictions all together.</p>
